# Directives & Components

You goal is to extend base tailwind theme with two new colours:
- `mint-500`: `#3EB489`
- `mint-600`: `#32926F`

Then you need to update your card component to use these new colours instead of `cyan-500` and `cyan-600`

> Here are the [Layout Tasks Instructions](https://mate-academy.github.io/layout_task-guideline)

### Requirements:

- index.html does not contain tailwindcss classes, only custom classes are used
- `card-dark` variation is used to style whole component accordingly
- `mint-500` and `mint-600` are added to the tailwind theme
- do not use native css, only use tailwindcss utility classes
- Find the required font on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and use.
